## Project Timeline

### **1. Define Requirements and Specifications**

- **Power Requirements**: Identify the power supply needs for the SoC, including input voltage, power rails (e.g., 3.3V, 5V), and current requirements. Check the SoC’s datasheet for power consumption details.
- **Peripheral and IO Interfaces**: List all the peripherals (e.g., storage, networking, USB ports, fan control, etc.) and their respective interfaces (PCIe, SATA, USB, Ethernet, GPIO).
- **Environmental Requirements**: Consider any constraints like operating temperature range, size, and mounting options if the SBC is intended for a specific enclosure.
- **Form Factor**: Define the dimensions of the PCB and where components like connectors and headers will be placed (e.g., mini-ITX, custom dimensions).

### **2. Study SoC Datasheet and Reference Designs**

- **Datasheet Review**: Thoroughly review the SoC’s datasheet, which contains all the electrical characteristics, pin functions, and layout guidelines. Focus on the following key sections:
- **Pinout**: Study the SoC’s pinout diagram and identify key signals like power pins, clock signals, reset pins, and communication interfaces (e.g., SPI, I2C, UART).
- **Power Supply and Decoupling**: Review the recommended power supply design, including voltage regulators, capacitors, and decoupling techniques.
- **Clock and Reset**: Understand how to provide the correct clock signals and reset circuitry to the SoC.
- **Reference Designs**: Find reference designs provided by the SoC manufacturer or community (e.g., open-source SBCs like the Rockchip-based Radxa Rock 5B or Marvell-based boards). These provide proven circuit designs for power management, routing, and component placement.

### **3. Power Supply Design**

- **Determine Voltage Rails**: Identify the required voltage rails (e.g., 1.8V, 3.3V, 5V) for the SoC, memory, and other peripherals. Based on the SoC’s power requirements, design or select power regulators to supply stable voltages.
- **Design Power Regulation Circuit**: Use switching regulators (e.g., buck converters) or linear regulators depending on the current requirements and thermal constraints.
- **Decoupling Capacitors**: Plan the placement of decoupling capacitors near the SoC’s power pins to ensure signal integrity and reduce noise.
- **Power Sequencing**: Some SoCs require specific power-up sequencing for the various voltage rails, so follow the datasheet’s guidelines to avoid damage.

### **4. Clock and Reset Circuit Design**

- **Clock Generation**: Select the appropriate oscillator or crystal for the SoC’s clock input, based on the frequency requirements from the datasheet (e.g., 24 MHz or 25 MHz for many SoCs).
- **Reset Circuit**: Design the reset circuit (either a manual reset button or an automatic power-on reset using external components like reset ICs). Ensure you account for reset timing requirements (if any) in the datasheet.

### **5. Select and Design for External Memory (if needed)**

- **RAM/Flash**: Based on the SoC’s requirements, choose the appropriate memory components (e.g., DDR4, LPDDR4 for RAM, eMMC or SPI Flash for boot memory). Carefully follow the datasheet for signal integrity and timing requirements when designing memory interfaces.
- **PCB Layout Guidelines**: Pay attention to the layout requirements for high-speed memory interfaces, such as DDR routing. Length-matching of signals and proper impedance control will be crucial to prevent data corruption.

### **6. Peripherals and Interface Design**

- **Ethernet and Networking**: If your SoC supports Ethernet, design the required Ethernet PHY, magnetics, and RJ45 connector circuit. For higher speeds (e.g., 10 GbE), ensure your PCB supports the necessary signal integrity.
- **USB and PCIe**: Design for USB and PCIe interfaces, ensuring proper routing of differential pairs, controlled impedance, and placement of necessary components like ESD protection diodes.
- **Fan Control**: If you plan to use PWM for fan control, include appropriate MOSFETs or drivers that connect to the SoC’s PWM-capable GPIO pins.

### **7. Schematic Capture**

- **Select a CAD Tool**: Use a schematic capture tool like **Altium Designer**, **KiCad**, or **Cadence Allegro** to create your design.
- **Create Component Symbols**: Ensure that you have accurate symbols and footprints for all your components, including the SoC. Most CAD tools allow you to download pre-made symbols from component libraries or manufacturer websites.
- **Schematic Design**: Start creating your schematic by:
- Connecting all power rails, decoupling capacitors, and clock/reset circuitry.
- Laying out the data buses (like DDR) and high-speed interfaces (like USB, PCIe).
- Adding interfaces like GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART as needed for peripherals and sensors.

### **8. PCB Layout and Design Rules**

- **Stackup Design**: Choose the number of PCB layers (e.g., 4-layer or 6-layer) based on the SoC’s complexity, high-speed signal requirements, and power distribution needs. Define the layer stackup to optimize for signal integrity and thermal management.
- **Place Components**: Start placing major components like the SoC, memory, and power management ICs. Use guidelines for component placement (e.g., keeping decoupling capacitors close to the SoC, placing oscillators near clock inputs).
- **Routing**: Carefully route critical signals like memory buses (DDR), high-speed interfaces (USB, PCIe), and differential pairs. Length-match signal traces where needed.
- **Ground Planes and Power Distribution**: Ensure good grounding by using solid ground planes. Design wide traces or power planes for high-current paths.

### **9. Simulation and Validation**

- **Signal Integrity Simulation**: For high-speed signals (e.g., DDR, USB, PCIe), run signal integrity simulations to ensure proper performance and reduce the risk of crosstalk or data errors.
- **Thermal Simulation**: Simulate heat dissipation and power distribution to ensure components don’t overheat, especially the SoC and power components.

### **10. Prototyping and Testing**

- **Manufacture a Prototype PCB**: Send your design to a PCB fabrication service to produce prototypes of your board.
- **Bring-Up Testing**: Once you have the physical board, perform bring-up testing by powering on the board, testing power rails, clock signals, and basic functionality (booting the SoC, testing peripherals).
